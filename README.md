# Super Sound Swapper
Formerly the "Bruh Sound Effects" mod, Super Sound Swapper is a highly customisable (and silly) mod that allows you to replace every single sound in the game (including those added by mods) with sounds on your computer!

Provide one or more paths to sounds in the config, and they'll be played instead of the original sounds. If a path or file is invalid, the classic Bruh Sound Effect #2 will be played instead.

There are several config options for changing the chance of a sound being swapped, retaining the pitch, volume and/or pan of the original sound, and randomising those three parameters.
